----

Move the downloaded .nro onto you Nintendo Switch SD Card inside the folder **/switch/kefirupdater/**.

That's it!

----

## Usage

__**The app currently has 4 main options.**__

**Update Atmosphere patches:**

* Downloads the latest Atmosphere patches. 
* It is no longer possible to update Atmosphere while you are running Atmosphere. [Atmosphere now maintains exclusive access to fusee-secondary archive.](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/commit/5b02c77400e8551199fefdbc36b1eb3ff86374dc)

**Update Hekate:**

* Installs the latest release of Hekate. The UMS feature may be a convenient way to update Atmosphere now.
* Offers to replace your **/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin** with Hekate, making Atmosphere reboot to Hekate. It will offer to copy your current **/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin** to **/bootloader/payloads/reboot_payload.bin** in order to avoid booting to hekate after install with no payloads. If you ran **Update Atmosphere + sigpatches** first, **/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin** is the latest **fusee-primary.bin**.

**Update App:**

* Downloads the latest version of this app!
* Deletes the previous old version.

**Reboot (reboot to payload):**

* Reboots the switch, loading the payload from **/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin**.
* This is recommended after install Atmosphere.
